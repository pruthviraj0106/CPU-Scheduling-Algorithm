      <p class="hd"><b>What is Page Replacement Algorithm?</b></p>
      
      <div id="intro">
        Page replacement algorithm is a process of selecting the page to be removed from the physical memory, also known as RAM, when there is no space left in the memory to accommodate new pages. The page replacement algorithm is used in operating systems to manage the memory by keeping frequently used pages in the main memory and swapping out the less used pages to the secondary memory, also known as a disk.

        In general, there are two types of page replacement algorithms - 
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>Global Page Replacement Algorithm: </b></li><br>
            Global page replacement algorithms work by selecting a page to replace from the entire set of pages in memory. This means that any page in memory can be replaced, regardless of which process it belongs to. Global page replacement algorithms are typically used in systems that have a relatively small number of processes running simultaneously.
            <br><br><li><b>Local Page Replacement Algorithm: </b></li><br>
            local page replacement algorithms work by selecting a page to replace from only the pages belonging to a particular process. This means that each process has its own set of pages that can be replaced, and pages belonging to one process are not replaced if another process needs space. Local page replacement algorithms are typically used in systems that have a large number of processes running simultaneously.
        </ol>
      <p class="hd"><b>Why do we need Page Replacement Algorithm?</b></p>

      <div id="why">
        Page replacement algorithms is widely used in computer operating systems because they help to manage the limited amount of physical memory available to programs. Programs often require more memory than is available in physical memory (RAM), so the operating system uses a portion of the hard disk as virtual memory. When a program requests a page of memory that is not currently in physical memory, the operating system retrieves the page from virtual memory and stores it in physical memory.

        However, physical memory is limited, so when all available memory is in use, the operating system must decide which pages to remove from physical memory to make room for new pages. This is where page replacement algorithms come in. They determine which pages to remove from physical memory when space is needed for new pages.

        Without a page replacement algorithm, programs would be unable to run if there is not enough physical memory available. By using page replacement algorithms, the operating system can ensure that the most important and frequently accessed pages are kept in physical memory, while less important pages are removed and stored in virtual memory until they are needed again.

        Overall, page replacement algorithms are essential for efficient memory management in computer operating systems. They help to optimize system performance and ensure that programs can run efficiently even when there is limited physical memory available.

    <p class="hd"><b>Various Page Replacement Algorithms</b></p>

      <div class="cont">
        <div>
            In computer operating systems, a page replacement algorithm is a technique used to manage memory by determining which pages should be removed from memory when space is needed for new pages. The choice of page replacement algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the system being used. Factors such as the number of processes running, the size of the memory cache, and the types of programs being run all influence the choice of algorithm.

            Here are some of the most commonly used page replacement algorithms:
          <h2 class=" heady">First-In, First-Out (FIFO): </h2></a>
          <p class="description">The FIFO algorithm works by replacing the oldest page in memory, regardless of how often it has been accessed. This algorithm is easy to implement, but it can lead to poor performance if the oldest pages are still being used frequently. This algorithm is useful in situations where the memory usage pattern is predictable and there are no time constraints.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class=" heady">Least Recently Used (LRU): <br></h2></a>
          <p class="description">The LRU algorithm works by keeping track of the order in which pages are accessed. When a page needs to be replaced, the algorithm selects the page that has not been accessed for the longest time. This ensures that the pages that are most likely to be used again are kept in memory. This algorithm is useful in situations where the memory usage pattern is unpredictable, and frequently accessed pages need to be kept in memory.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class=" heady">Clock (or Second Chance): </h2></a>
          <p class="description">The Clock algorithm maintains a circular list of pages, each of which has a reference bit that is set to 1 when the page is accessed. When a page needs to be replaced, the algorithm scans through the circular list until it finds a page with a reference bit of 0. If it finds a page with a reference bit of 1, it clears the reference bit and moves on to the next page in the list. This process continues until a page with a reference bit of 0 is found. This algorithm is useful in situations where the working set of a process is relatively small and the reference bit can be used to predict future page accesses.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class=" heady">Least-Frequently Used (LFU): </h2></a>
          <p class="description">The LFU algorithm works by keeping track of the number of times each page is accessed. When a page needs to be replaced, the algorithm selects the page that has been accessed the fewest number of times. This algorithm is useful in situations where certain pages are accessed much more frequently than others.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
         <h2 class=" heady">Most-Frequently Used (MFU):</h2></a>
          <p class="description">The MFU algorithm works by keeping track of the number of times each page is accessed. When a page needs to be replaced, the algorithm selects the page that has been accessed the most number of times. This algorithm is useful in situations where certain pages are accessed much less frequently than others.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2 class=" heady">Random:</h2></a>
            <p class="description">The Random algorithm works by selecting a page to replace at random. While this algorithm is easy to implement, it can result in poor performance if frequently used pages are randomly selected for replacement.</p>
        </div>
          Hence, there are several different CPU scheduling algorithms that can be used depending on the specific needs of a system. The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on factors such as the nature of the system, the characteristics of the processes, and the performance requirements.
      </div>
      
    The choice of page replacement algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the system being used. Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm will depend on the specific requirements of the system being used. By carefully selecting the appropriate algorithm for a given situation, it is possible to optimize memory usage and improve overall system performance.
